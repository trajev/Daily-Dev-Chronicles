Welcome to my Daily Dev Chronicle!

Here I Upload daily one new project to maintain my consistency and enhance my coding skills.

### Steps to access projects

1. git clone "https://github.com/trajev/daily-dev-chronicles.git"
2. cd "daily-dev-chronicles"

### Future Updates

I'm actively post new projects daily on this repo, and once I finish all of them, I'll be updating this README to provide more detailed information about all projects.
